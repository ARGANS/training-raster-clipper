# Introduction to QGIS and Sentinel-2 Level-2 product processing with Python


QGIS is a software aimed at reading and manipulating geographical data, such as rasters and vectorial geometries.

The goal of this introduction is a 360-degrees round trip starting from reading then writing data with QGIS, reading this data with Python tools such as pandas, rasterio, rioxarray and processing it before finally visualizing the final result back in QGIS.

More concretely, this tutorial will make you do the following:
- Download and import a Sentinel-2 product in QGIS ;
- Draw geometric shapes to samples zones corresponding to water, farmland and forest ;
- Read the results from the two previous steps with Python ;
- Generate an intermediate data structure containing reflectance values (R, G, B, NIR) from the Sentinel-2 product intersected with the priorly defined classified polygons (water, farmland, forest) ;
- Feed this data structure to a machine learning model and use it to classify the pixels of the Sentinel-2 product ;
- Import the resulting raster into QGIS and visualize it.


It is recommended to watch this video beforehand : [link to Klas video introduction] to become more familiar with the QGIS user interface.

This introduction also assumes a prior minimal knowledge of the Python language : defining functions, list comprehensions. Nevertheless, if you don't have this knowledge yet, be reassured, the language usage in this tutorial will be simple enough so anyone having a prior programming experience can follow along.

The Python code will be broken down in independant smaller functions, for easier debugging.

[TODO : provide typed function signatures as a starting point for the coding practice, to be filled by the tutorial follower]

TODO export palette with python and auto import in QGIS
